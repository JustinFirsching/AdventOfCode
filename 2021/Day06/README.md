I really liked this problem. I expected scaling to be an issue when doing Part
1, but I wanted to get the log that the example produced to get me started as
well. Ultimately, that was probably a waste, but I wrote the entire Part 2
solution that I should've just started with before the Part1 solution could run
the Part 2 input. It actually still hasn't finished (to this day, consindering
I am about to kill it) after 18 minutes.
